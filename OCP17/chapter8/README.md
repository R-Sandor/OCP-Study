# Lamdas and Functional Interfaces 

## Lambda parameters
lambdas can not use the same variables as declared in the enclosing scope: 
- mehtod parameters
- local variables that are in scope

## Var
- lambdas can not be assigned to var, there is not enough information to determin the type. 

## Function and Consumer 
- Both support and then method for chaining functions.
